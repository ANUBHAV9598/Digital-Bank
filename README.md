The Bank project is developed using Java Swing to create a user-friendly interface for managing basic banking functions. 
Users can carry out tasks such as opening accounts, choosing account types (e.g., savings or checking), searching for specific
accounts, and performing other necessary banking operations. Java Swing's graphical capabilities ensure that the application is 
interactive and visually appealing, making it easy for both customers and bank personnel to navigate and utilize its features effectively. 
This project demonstrates how Java Swing can be used to create functional and intuitive banking software solutions.
